# project-planner
Project discripton
A project planner that asks the user for how many milestones are going to take place and how many activites are in each 
milestone. Then prompts the user how long/much the project will take/cost, then it prompts the user to enter a choice to either
print the milestones or update them or exit.


a1_functions.c has the functions code, while .h has the header files and a1_data_structures.h has the structs used in the project.
